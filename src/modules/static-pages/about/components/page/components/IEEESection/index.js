                IEEE is the worldâ€™s largest technical professional organization
                dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.
                IEEE and its members inspire a global community through its
                highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards,
                and professional and educational activities. IEEE has a dual
                complementary regional and technical structure with
                organizational units based on geography and technical focus. It
                manages a separate organizational unit (IEEE-USA) which
                recommends policies and implements programs specifically
                intended to benefit the members, the profession, and the public
                in the United States.
